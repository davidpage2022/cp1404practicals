# CP1404 Practicals

This repository contains my practical work for Programming II - CP1404.

## Features

* Improved programming language code (from prac_06).
* Extended guitar exercises (from prac_06).
* Project management program for loading, saving, viewing and modifying projects.
* Project management extended to save and load data in JSON format.

## Author

My name is David Page. I'm an IT student at JCU.

## Clean Code Tips

* Be very deliberate about naming decisions. Good naming makes code readable, self-documenting and sets up clear
  expectations about how code is to be used. For example, singular in plural is an excellent pattern in for loops.
* Use established coding conventions for common tasks. Don't reinvent the wheel. For example, there
  are [patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns) for menus and error checking. Following
  these helps other programmers to understand your code and avoid unexpected side effects.
* Be DRY, but also be practical. Don't Repeat Yourself is a good principle in general to follow to help keep code
  maintainable, reusable and well organised. However, there are some cases where simple repetition makes for cleaner
  code than trying to strictly enforce DRY.
